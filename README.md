# javascript-challenges4
codecademy fourth attempt

My first README file
====================
Trying out new markdown skills 
------------------------------
# Header with one hashtag

In this file, I can **take notes** about the javascript projects I'm working on. 
For example, I can write down:
1. Changes I made to the document
2. Sources of code snippets found on the web
3. Whether attempts fail or succeed

Other reasons for maintaining this file: 
- Use markup for the first time

    This is a comment on the bullet point above
    
- Keep track of coding skills learned 
- Sharing with others
